# Conway's Game of Life

## Description
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## Implementation
This implementation is written in C++ using the standard library and the SDL2 library

## Controls
To exit press escape. To stop simulation use left mouse button. To refresh field you can use space bar or right mouse button.

## Plans
I plan to add more controls to the game, perhaps integrate an editor, make settings to a file.
